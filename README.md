# Daily-Python-Algorithm-Demo

This repo is backup for my personal daily python algorithm practices. 

</br>In despite of python's drawbacks on performace (Because it is a dynamic programming language), but it saves my time. I'm also forcing myself use Golang when the performance is crucial.

</br>My recommended book for beginer to python would be `Learning Python - O'Reilly Media`. 
</br>My suggested Golang tutorial would be [The way to go](https://github.com/Unknwon/the-way-to-go_ZH_CN).
</br>My suggested Python algorithm ebook is [All Algorithms - Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python).
</br>My favourite online programming web is [Lintcode](https://www.lintcode.com)
